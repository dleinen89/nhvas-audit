# Mass Management Accreditation Self-Audit Guidance

## Introduction

This document provides detailed guidance for businesses conducting self-audits to ensure compliance with Mass Management Accreditation under the National Heavy Vehicle Accreditation Scheme (NHVAS). It expands on each standard with best practices, examples, and checklists to help companies assess their compliance effectively. It is written with less experienced staff in mind—those who may be unfamiliar with mass management processes or NHVAS accreditation.

## Standard 1: Responsibilities

### Requirement

The authorities, responsibilities, and duties of all positions involved in the Mass Management System are clearly defined and documented. These roles must be allocated to people with appropriate skills or training.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Document Roles and Duties:
- Create a **Mass Management System (MMS) Manual** that includes a list of all relevant tasks (e.g. load checking, record-keeping, auditing) and who is responsible for each.
- Ensure everyone with these responsibilities has a clear understanding of their tasks.

#### Communicate Responsibilities:
- Conduct **briefings or training sessions** to ensure relevant staff know what is required of them.
- Keep a **simple organisational chart or responsibility matrix**.

### Best Practices
- Use a **Responsibility Matrix** with tasks vs. names or job titles.
- Provide short refresher sessions whenever tasks are updated or staff change.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Have all mass management tasks been documented in writing?
- Do staff members know their responsibilities and how to access written instructions?
- Is there a procedure for ensuring changes in responsibility are updated promptly?

## Standard 2: Vehicle Control

### Requirement

Only properly nominated vehicles are included in your Mass Management System. Each vehicle (or subcontracted vehicle) must have the correct technical ratings to carry the mass claimed.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Maintain a Vehicle Register:
- Include each nominated vehicle’s **registration, VIN, GVM/GCM, tare weight, and any relevant suspension approvals** (e.g. Road Friendly Suspension certification).
- Update the register whenever vehicles join or leave.

#### Check Technical Ratings:
- Keep **manufacturer’s specs, engineering certificates, or mass permits** if required for higher mass limits (HML).

#### Manage Subcontractors:
- If subcontractors’ vehicles are **“captive”** to your accreditation, document a formal arrangement confirming they operate under your system exclusively.

### Best Practices
- Use a **spreadsheet or fleet management software** to track vehicles.
- Conduct a **quarterly check** on registration details and permit validity.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Is the vehicle register complete and up-to-date?
- Do you have documents proving each vehicle’s mass ratings?
- Are subcontracted vehicles clearly identified, with evidence of exclusivity?

## Standard 3: Vehicle Use

### Requirement

You must determine the mass of each vehicle (axle and gross) before it leaves, ensuring you do not exceed legal limits.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Documented Loading Methods:
- **Weighbridge use, on-board scales, or volumetric calculations** (e.g. known product density).
- Include steps for dealing with **density variations or partial loads**.

#### Verification of Load Limits:
- Train staff to **read weighbridge or scale data properly**.
- When third parties load vehicles, specify a method for **confirming final weight**.

### Best Practices
- If using **on-board scales**, schedule **regular calibrations or cross-check with a weighbridge**.
- Keep **sample weigh dockets** to verify the system is working.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Are there written instructions on how to measure vehicle mass for each load type?
- Do staff record the load weight (gross and axle if possible) before departure?
- Is there a contingency for ensuring mass accuracy if equipment (e.g. weighbridge) is unavailable?

## Standard 4: Records and Documentation

### Requirement

Maintain documented evidence demonstrating your Mass Management System is functioning.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Trip Records:
- Retain **weighbridge dockets, loading sheets, or other proof of mass** for each above-GML trip.

#### Defect/Infringement Register:
- Record the **date, place, nature of offence/defect, and how it was rectified**.

#### Document Control:
- Ensure only **current procedures** are used across your sites.
- Retain **old documents for at least three years**.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Can you produce trip records for any specific date/trip if asked?
- Does a register exist for all defect or infringement notices?
- Do all locations and relevant staff have the same (current) version of the MMS manual?

---

## Standard 5: Verification

### Requirement

Your mass measurement methods must be tested (verified) periodically to confirm accuracy.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Regular Calibration or Cross-Checks:
- At least **twice a year**, compare your measuring method (e.g. on-board scales) against a **certified weighbridge**.

#### Record Verification:
- Keep **weighbridge dockets or calibration certificates** as proof.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Do you verify your measurement method (on-board scale, volume calculations) at least every six months?
- Are calibration/verification records filed for easy reference?

---

## Standard 6: Internal Review

### Requirement

Conduct **annual internal reviews** and produce **quarterly compliance statements**.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Annual Internal Audit:
- Check all NHVAS Mass Management standards against actual practice.
- Use a **non-conformance report** if procedures are not followed.

#### Quarterly Compliance Statements:
- Summarise **vehicle numbers, total trips above GML, non-compliances, and any relevant defect or infringement notices**.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Do you have a written internal audit procedure listing scope, responsibilities, and timing?
- Is there a **non-conformance register** and evidence that issues are corrected?
- Have you produced and signed off your quarterly compliance statements?

---

## Standard 7: Training and Education

### Requirement

Anyone with mass management responsibilities must be **trained in the relevant policies, procedures, and tasks**.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Training Plan:
- Identify roles needing training (**drivers, dispatchers, weighbridge operators**).
- Schedule **refresher training** if processes or legislation change.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Do you have a **training register** detailing each session?
- Are staff aware of their responsibilities and how to comply with Mass Management requirements?
- Have you scheduled refresher training or induction for new employees?

---

## Standard 8: Maintenance of Suspension

### Requirement

Suspensions must be **maintained according to manufacturer/engineer specs**.

### Ways to Meet the Standard

#### Documented Maintenance Schedules:
- Outline **when and how suspensions are checked** (time/distance intervals, fault reporting).

#### Fault Reporting Procedures:
- Detail how drivers notify the **workshop or manager if a fault is found “on the road”**.

#### Records of Repairs:
- Keep documentation of **repairs, parts used, person who performed the repair, and sign-off**.

### Self-Audit Checklist
- Do you have a **clear maintenance schedule** for suspensions?
- Is there a **procedure for handling urgent suspension faults** discovered away from base?
- Are mechanics **formally qualified**, and do you keep proof?

---

## Conclusion

Regular **self-audits** help ensure your business remains compliant with the NHVAS Mass Management accreditation standards. By following the steps above—maintaining accurate records, verifying load measurement systems, performing scheduled internal audits, and keeping staff well-trained—you will reduce the likelihood of **non-conformances** and establish a strong **culture of compliance and safety**.
