# Project Brief

## Project Name
**Mass Management Accreditation Self-Audit Tool**

## Goals
1. Develop a tool to help businesses conduct self-audits for compliance with Mass Management Accreditation under the National Heavy Vehicle Accreditation Scheme (NHVAS).
2. Provide clear, actionable guidance for businesses to assess their compliance with NHVAS standards.
3. Simplify the self-audit process for less experienced staff by offering detailed checklists, examples, and best practices.
4. Generate leads for compliance consulting services by identifying areas where businesses need assistance.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Development of a web-based tool to guide users through the self-audit process.
- Creation of detailed documentation for each NHVAS Mass Management standard, including:
  - Responsibilities
  - Vehicle Control
  - Vehicle Use
  - Records and Documentation
  - Verification
  - Internal Review
  - Training and Education
  - Maintenance of Suspension
- Implementation of user-friendly features such as:
  - Interactive checklists
  - Progress tracking
  - Exportable audit reports
- Integration of best practices and examples to assist users in understanding and meeting standards.

### Out of Scope
- Legal advice or interpretation of NHVAS regulations.
- Direct integration with government systems or databases.
- Physical hardware (e.g., weighbridges, on-board scales).

## Key Requirements
1. **User Experience**
   - The tool must be intuitive and easy to use, even for staff with limited technical or regulatory knowledge.
   - Provide clear instructions and visual aids (e.g., diagrams, flowcharts) to guide users.

2. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Include detailed explanations of each NHVAS standard.
   - Provide checklists and examples to help users assess their compliance.
   - Allow users to upload and store evidence documents for each standard.
   - Enable cross-referencing of documents across multiple standards.

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - The tool will be web-based for cross-platform accessibility.
   - Ensure data security and privacy for user inputs.
   - Allow users to save and export their audit results.
   - Track compliance progress over time with exportable reports.

4. **Lead Generation**
   - Identify compliance gaps where consulting services could be beneficial.
   - Collect data on common compliance challenges.
   - Potential for automated review emails offering assistance.

4. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - The tool should be easy to update as NHVAS standards evolve.
   - Include a mechanism for users to provide feedback or report issues.

## Deliverables
1. **Phase 1: Research and Design**
   - Conduct a thorough review of NHVAS Mass Management standards.
   - Develop wireframes and user flow diagrams for the tool.

2. **Phase 2: Development**
   - Build the core functionality of the tool, including interactive checklists and progress tracking.
   - Implement user authentication and data export features.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Validation**
   - Test the tool with a small group of users to identify and fix issues.
   - Validate compliance with NHVAS standards.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment**
   - Launch the tool for public use.
   - Provide user documentation and support resources.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Research and design (wireframes, user flows).
- **Week 3-6:** Core development (checklists, progress tracking).
- **Week 7-8:** Testing and validation.
- **Week 9:** Deployment and user training.

## Success Metrics
1. **User Adoption**
   - At least 100 businesses using the tool within the first 3 months of launch.
2. **Compliance Improvement**
   - 90% of users report improved understanding of NHVAS standards after using the tool.
3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Average user rating of 4.5/5 or higher for ease of use and usefulness.

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Risk:** Users may find the tool too complex.
   - **Mitigation:** Conduct user testing early and often to refine the interface.
2. **Risk:** NHVAS standards may change during development.
   - **Mitigation:** Design the tool to be easily updatable.
3. **Risk:** Data security concerns.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement robust encryption and access controls.

## Stakeholders
1. **Primary Users**
   - Businesses seeking NHVAS Mass Management accreditation.
   - Staff responsible for compliance and auditing.
2. **Secondary Users**
   - Regulatory bodies (e.g., NHVAS administrators).
   - Industry associations promoting compliance.
3. **Business Stakeholders**
   - Compliance consultants/auditors who will use the tool for lead generation.

---

## Future Expansion
- The system will be designed to accommodate additional NHVAS modules:
  - Fatigue Management
  - Maintenance Management
- Users will have a single account that can access any/all modules they're using.
- The tool may eventually link to a broader NHVAS compliance software platform.

## Next Steps
1. Review and finalize this project brief.
2. Begin creating `productContext.md` to define the problems this project solves and the user experience goals.
3. Develop `systemPatterns.md` to outline the system architecture and key technical decisions.
