# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is in the initial development phase. We have established the project brief, created the memory bank, and set up the basic project structure. We have implemented the core authentication functionality and started building the Mass Management module. The focus is now on developing the user interface components and implementing the audit functionality.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief outlining goals, scope, and requirements
- Added reference materials for NHVAS Mass Management standards
- Initialized memory bank with core documentation files
- Defined product context, system patterns, and technical context
- Clarified the dual purpose of the tool: helping businesses with compliance and generating leads for consulting services
- Cleaned up project structure to match the architecture defined in techContext.md
- Set up proper directory structure for client, server, and shared code
- Installed required dependencies for both client and server
- Created the server-side skeleton with Express
- Set up MongoDB connection
- Implemented user authentication (models, controllers, routes)
- Created the client-side React application with Material-UI
- Implemented routing and authentication on the client-side
- Created the Mass Management audit model and controller
- Designed and implemented the home page and registration/login pages

## Active Decisions

### 1. Architecture Approach
- Decided on a web-based application with React frontend and Node.js backend
- Adopted a modular design to accommodate all NHVAS standards and future modules
- Implemented progressive disclosure pattern to manage complexity for users
- Centralized document storage with cross-referencing capabilities

### 2. User Experience Strategy
- Focus on simplicity for less experienced staff
- Interactive checklists with guidance materials
- "Not Sure" options to identify areas where users need assistance
- Progress tracking and exportable reports
- Document upload and management system

### 3. Lead Generation Approach
- Track compliance gaps and "Not Sure" responses
- Collect data on common compliance challenges
- Potential for automated follow-up emails offering assistance
- Analytics to identify industry-wide trends

### 4. Technical Stack
- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Material-UI for consistent, accessible interface
- Cloud-based document storage
- JWT authentication for security

## Current Questions/Considerations
- What specific security measures are needed for document storage?
- How to best structure the interactive checklists for each standard?
- What is the optimal user flow for document upload and cross-referencing?
- How to design the reporting system to highlight compliance gaps effectively?
- What analytics should be captured for lead generation purposes?

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Mass Management Module
- Create routes for the Mass Management audit API
- Implement file upload functionality for evidence documents
- Build interactive checklists for each of the 8 standards
- Develop the audit progress tracking system
- Create the compliance scoring algorithm

### 2. User Interface Development
- Enhance the dashboard to display audit progress
- Create the audit checklist interface with progressive disclosure
- Build the document management interface
- Implement the reporting interface

### 3. Testing and Refinement
- Test the authentication system
- Validate the Mass Management audit functionality
- Test the document upload and management system
- Ensure proper error handling throughout the application

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Need to finalize the exact requirements for document storage and management
- May need additional clarification on specific NHVAS interpretations
- Need to determine data retention requirements for audit records
- Security requirements for sensitive business information
